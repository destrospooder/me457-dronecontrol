**Description:**<br/>
This course prepares students to do research in the rapidly evolving of field of autonomous navigation, guidance, and control of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). In particular, students will learn about key concepts from rigid-body dynamics, aerodynamics, feedback control, and state estimation using sensors, to maneuver through obstacles. Traditional homework assignments are replaced with a semester-long simulation software development project in Python. Techniques developed will be applied in the form of student design projects.
